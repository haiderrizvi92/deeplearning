## Introduction to deep learning

In the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been a subject of intense media
hype. Machine learning, deep learning, and AI come up in countless articles, often
outside of technology-minded publications. We’re promised a future of intelligent
chatbots, self-driving cars, and virtual assistants—a future sometimes painted in a
grim light and other times as utopian, where human jobs will be scarce and most
economic activity will be handled by robots or AI agents. For a future or current
practitioner of machine learning, it’s important to be able to recognize the signal
in the noise so that you can tell world-changing developments from overhyped
press releases.

## what you will learn in deep learning
You’ll learn from more than 30 code examples that include detailed commentary,
practical recommendations, and simple high-level explanations of everything you
need to know to start using deep learning to solve concrete problems
